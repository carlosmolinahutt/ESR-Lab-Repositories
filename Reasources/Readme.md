- [Structural Analysis]()
- [Machine Learning](#machine-learning)


## OpenSees
[Blog about OpenSees related topics by Michael Scott](https://portwooddigital.com/)
Michael is OpenSees's core developer. His blog is very useful for understanding some of OpenSees's nuance. 

[Videos about OpenSees by Sr. Silvia Mazzoni](https://www.youtube.com/c/SilviasBrainery/videos)
Silvia videos are on TCL, but Silvia really knows her stuff.

[Dimitri Lignos videos on opensees and steel structures](https://www.youtube.com/user/DLJapan/videos)
Dimitri Lignos has some useful videos on modelling moment resisting frames in OpenSees, as well as other intro topics.

## Siesmic Hazard
[Videos on PSHA by Dr. Kevin Franke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv5lxy74hxo&list=PLzBZ3hmMnx1ItfMeO9aGQ5PnC65_TeTBv&index=8)
Very useful for understanding PSHA in simple terms!


## Programing
[Introducttion to Clean coding and software design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EmboKQH8lM&t=1198s):
An philosphical overview of how to write software efficiently. Useful if you are working on larger programming projects.

## Python Libraries
[Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/whats_new.html):
A reasource for ploting Cartographic figures, built on top of Matplotlib.

## Machine Learning
[Machine learning online Textbook](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html)
A really good free reasource on the mathematics behind machine learning, with python examples.
